<div class="research-content">

  <p>
  I started as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Mississippi State University in the Fall of 2025. Previously, I was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow (Plant Genomes Research Program) working with <a href="https://wessingerlab.github.io/">Dr. Carrie Wessinger</a> at the University of South Carolina. I received my BS in Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at The Ohio State University, and stayed at OSU to work with Dr. Andi Wolfe for my PhD, where I studied comparative phylogeography and systematics in the shrubby Penstemons (<i>Penstemon</i> subgenus <i>Dasanthera</i>).
