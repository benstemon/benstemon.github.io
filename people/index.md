  <p>
  I started as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Mississippi State University in the Fall of 2025. Previously, I was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow (Plant Genomes Research Program) working with <a href="https://wessingerlab.github.io/">Dr. Carrie Wessinger</a> at the University of South Carolina. I received my BS in Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at The Ohio State University, and stayed at OSU to work with Dr. Andi Wolfe for my PhD, where I studied comparative phylogeography and systematics in the shrubby Penstemons (<i>Penstemon</i> subgenus <i>Dasanthera</i>).

  I completed my B.S. in Biology from Maryville University in St. Louis, Missouri in 2025. During this time, I was a member of Kyra Krakosâ€™ lab with Missouri Botanical Garden where I did work on <i>Nymphaea odorata</i> and <i>Iris virginica</i>. From 2022-2025, I was a member of the team on the USDA urban orchard project with Maryville University, Webster University, University of Missouri St. Louis, Saint Louis University, and the St. Louis Zoo. Most of my research has focused on pollination studies and overall reproductive success of plant species. My PhD work will focus on the ecological, evolutionary, and genetic aspects of nectar production in <i>Physostegia</i> species.
