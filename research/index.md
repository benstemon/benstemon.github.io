[//]: # (Top section. Spruce this up with Icons, images, etc.)

We aim to understand the evolutionary origins and genetic architecture of phenotypic and ecological variation, primarily in the emerging model plant genus *Penstemon*. We use genomic, phenotypic, and ecological data generated from *in situ* populations and experimental approaches to answer questions about adaptation, speciation, convergent evolution, and species' responses to environmental change.

# Genomics in a rapid continental adaptive radiation

*Penstemon* serves as an exceptional emerging model system to explore key evolutionary questions through diverse approaches including phylogenomics, population genomics, and comparative approaches.

  <i>Penstemon</i> is the largest angiosperm genus endemic to North America and exhibits an incredible array of phenotypic and ecological diversity across its nearly 300 described species. Floral diversity is considered a key axis of adaptive variation. In particular, repeated evolutionary transitions are common, with an estimated >20 independent transitions from bee pollination to hummingbird pollination. Many species have also apparently adapted to specific substrates and habitats, such as sand dunes, limestone, and talus/shale/scree.</p>

# Hybrid Zones: natural laboratories

<div class="research-content">

  <p>
  The recency of the <i>Penstemon</i> radiation has resulted in many incomplete barriers to reproduction, and hybrid zones between closely related species form frequently. We leverage these naturally phenotypically and genetically mixed populations to identify genomic regions underlying traits of interest. Our most recent projects investigate hybrid zones that form between shrubby Penstemons (subgenus <i>Dasanthera</i>) with divergent pollination syndromes (bee vs. hummingbird).</p>

# Phylogeography and conservation genetics

Many *Penstemon* species are of conservation concern for state and federal agencies and are threatened by climate change. The broad geographic distribution of *Penstemon* species across diverse ecosystems coupled with the propensity of its species toward narrow endemism and habitat specialization makes it an interesting group in which to study species’ responses to environmental change from both phylogeographic and conservation perspectives.
